# Hack Kitchen
Hack Kitchen is a beginner-friendly coding puzzle 🧩 competition that encourages creativity 🎨 in technology. Participants will be immersed in a full day of cooking-show 🍳 themed puzzles, curveball surprises 🙀, and fan-favorite Gordon Ramsay references. As with all our events, no coding experience is necessary! While gaining experience 💪🏼 with using Github to submit your puzzles, you will be able to explore web development through React, test your programming skills with fast-paced ⚡️ coding problems, and laugh (or cry 😅) as you try to program in an esoteric programming language 🤯. Will you survive a dinner service from Hell’s Kitchen, become the next MasterChef 🧑‍🍳, or have your dish on the Chopping block 🔪?
